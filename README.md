## Coding Style

- Components are contained in hierarchal folders. A standalone component would be contained within a folder of the same name, with a css styling file of the same name as well.

- Components serving similar purposes would be contained within a folder with a name matching their shared functionality. They could have their own respective css files, or 1 central css file that they will all use.

- Components to be used for certain pages and/or layouts would be contained in their respective page/layout folder. If a component that falls under this category is complex and requires other smaller elements, it would be contained in a folder with a matching name, while the smaller dependable components would share that folder with the alpha component.

- Asides the theme context, all other context values must be objects or list of objects containing at least respective 'text' and 'value' key/value pairs.

- Reusability of render elements and logic is optimal. Even if not reused immediately, but at least to make scalability more seamless for future updates.
